## Pierre Dewitte

Researcher in Law | KU Leuven Centre for IT & IP Law | Belgium   

Pierre joined the KU Leuven Centre for IT & IP in October 2017 where he conducts interdisciplinary research on privacy engineering, smart cities and algorithmic transparency. His main research track seeks to bridge the gap between software engineering practices and data protection regulations by creating a common conceptual framework for both disciplines and providing decision and trade-off support for technical and organizational mitigation strategies in the software development life-cycle. He is also involved in multiple enforcement actions challenging the application of the General Data Protection Regulation to new technologies such as programmatic advertising and artificial intelligence.
