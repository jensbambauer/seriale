With the Seriale Pro we present a platform for the international digital series industry."
        - text: "die Seriale was launched by the two film makers, Csongor Dobrotka (Number of Silence) and Dennis Albrecht (Filmstadt), on June 12th, 2015 in order to offer German-speaking independent series a platform beyond the internet, as well; to highlight their innovative nature and their extraordinary quality and to connect the series creators among each other. The exchange between the filmmakers was supposed to enhance the quality of the format and to establish new perspectives in producing and publication."

#   heading: Our values
#   text: >-
#     Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too – one
#     of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives. We
#     want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s
#     exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.
