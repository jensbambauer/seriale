        - text: "die Seriale - DigitalSeriesFestival Giessen is the oldest festival in Germany dedicated to present and celebrate digital series. Our goal is to connect, support and pay tribute to all talented creators from around the world and to advertise their wonderful work. On four festival days lectures, workshops and panel discussions will be held. All selected series will be screened in the local cinema. The most outstanding series will be awarded by an expert jury. With the Seriale Pro events we present a platform for the international digital series industry."
        - text: "die Seriale was launched by the two film makers, Dennis Albrecht (Filmstadt) and Csongor Dobrotka (Number of Silence), on June 12th, 2015 in order to offer German- speaking independent series a platform beyond the internet, as well; to highlight their innovative nature and their extraordinary quality and to connect the series creators among each other. The exchange between the filmmakers was supposed to enhance the quality of the format and to establish new perspectives in producing and publication."

#   heading: Our values
#   text: >-
#     Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too – one
#     of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives. We
#     want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s
#     exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.
