## Flight 69 | German Premiere
Country: France | Genre: Comedy | Writer & Director: Karine de Falchi

Each episode of “Flight 69” tells the story of a particular flight. The crew is composed of 4 people, Jean the pilot, Teddy and Karim the flight attendants, and Nathalie the chief purser. They are all a bit out of place in their job, unable to do their work properly, and neither reassure the passengers nor guarantee their safety! The flight destinations are also characters on their own, highlighting our cultural differences and our diversity.
