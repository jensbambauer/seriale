**Interview with George Reese, Director and Co-Writer of Utopia Planitia & Founder and Co-Director of Minnesota WebFest**

A quote about good and evil, seen as human constructs and the human ability to create paradise or hell, inspired George Reese, to create his dystopian Science-Fiction series, which takes place on Mars. The post-climate-change scenario in _Utopia Planitia_ could stand for this idea. Mankind turned up the paradise given to him, the earth, into hell and therefore created an outpost and quite an utopian society on Mars. A society where no one suspects murder when a body is found. The more evidence is coming up the colonists have to face the fact that their society is not a moral exception at all. George Reese is founder and co-director of the _Minnesota WebFest_, which is a partner of the Seriale since its foundation in 2017. Two things are close to his heart, the importance of an international exchange between producers of web series and the presentation of local qualities.
