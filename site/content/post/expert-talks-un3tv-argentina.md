UN3 is the channel of the National University of Tres de Febrero in Buenos Aires, Argentina. It's an innovative channel which is including educational videos for young people and therefore cooperates with the Ministry of Education from Argentina. Most of their projects are web series in cooperation with the Institute of Cinema, for example their current biggest project _Breaking Point_, which is their first series in Virtual Reality. This series consists of eight episodes: Four of them are showing the first dates of different couples and the other half their breakups.
