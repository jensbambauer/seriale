**Interview with Catherine White, Writer and Director of _Caterpillars' Times_, Canada**

A caterpillar's life is defined by its metamorphosis into a butterfly – or a moth. While previously its main interest has been nutrition in this crucial period its circumstances are changing dramatically – right before the adolescent gets rid of its constraining hull to spread out the wings for the first time. Sounds like a good metaphor for a coming-of-age story? Welcome to the colourful world of _Caterpillars' Times_ (2017) a digital series – which received an Honorable Mention of the Jury at die Seriale 2019 – concerning young Québécoise Alix who after her 21st birthday finds herself plunged in at the deep end on an adventure about love, friendship and the longing for independence. 

In this interview Catherine White, writer and director of the series, who also works as an art director and set designer, was asked about the unique visual aesthetics of her work. She talks about her inspiration and the perks of being slightly hearing-impaired. Also we gain an insight into the relationship between the characters Alix and her best friend Bibi, played by the best friend of Catherine White - being shaped by profound betweenness – the core trope of _Caterpillars' Times_.
