**"Anomalie" | Germany**

**Interview with Christian Stadach, Stephan Böhl and Marc Boutter | Tag & Nacht Media**

If we have learned anything from Netflix recent hit series “Dark” (2017) it's that time and identity are as intertwined as in a state of flux. The award-winning digital series “Anomalie” (2019), that won the award “Best Director” at last year's Seriale, shows that the hype about coming-of-age stories to explore mysterious family relations and the realm of the supernatural is far from over. 

In this video we introduce you to Stephan Böhl and Christian Stadach – both heart and mind behind “Anomalie” – who founded the production company Tag & Nacht Media together with Thomas Meudt, out of a seminar room at Darmstadt University. As Darmstadt is also the place where the events of the series unfold, they discuss the significance of filming locations yet unknown touching on their importance for developing a unique cinematographic style. Moreover leading actor Marc Boutter talks about the protagonist's quest to find out about his identity and the past of his parents. Be assured he's giving no spoilers about the twisted ending of "Anomalie"… ;-)

**"Anomalie" (Season 1, Part 2) won the award for "Best Production Design" at "die Seriale" 2020.**
