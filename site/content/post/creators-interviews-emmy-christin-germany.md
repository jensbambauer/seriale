The web series _Emmy & Christin_ is about the best friends Emmy (Anna Marlene Wirtz) and Christin (Elena Halangk), who share a desire of adventure that leads them to disastrous events. The two producers and writers give us an insight on their inspirations, explain how it all started on social media and what the series has to do with Quentin Tarantino. Marco Eisenbarth talks about his experience as DOP and the risk he took shooting the iconic looking final scene of _Emmy & Christin_.

Anna Marlene Wirtz studied the Italia Conti Academy of Theatre Arts in London and acts for independent movies. She gained experiences with web series through her roles in Anomalie (2019) and the German-Korean co-production Lotte Haus (2019). Elena Halangk mainly acts for image and independent movies, but also had a role in the funk web series _Country Girls_ (2017). Marco Eisenbarth, who is successful with his wrestling documentary series _Bastards._ (2019) and _Bastard2. Bad Company_ (2021), co-produced by the Hessian TV Broadcasting which can be seen in the ARD Mediathek was the DOP of _Anomalie_ (2019), where he met Anna Marlene Wirtz. She later asked him to be the cinematographer for _Emmy & Christin_ (2020).
