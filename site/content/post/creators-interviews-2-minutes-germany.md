Two minutes can be life changing. The award-winning web series _2 Minutes_ (2020) written by Lisa Miller shows very different perspectives on the events happening around doing a pregnancy test. It shows women desperately trying to get pregnant, those who are afraid of it or simply choose to not want a baby at all, as well as disabled women with the wish of giving birth, so a lot of actresses got involved. The series was created for the public broadcast MDR under the label Red Pony Pictures powered by Saxonia Media. We asked one of the three producers Daniela Zentner, who has been working for Saxonia Media since 2018, how the production of _2 Minutes_ went and what role political correctness and social media played for the web-series. She also tells us about her reasons to produce the series.
