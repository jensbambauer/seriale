**Interview with actress Genie Kim, director Young Man Kang and producer Joo-hyun Yoo**

_Lotte Haus_ is a web series co-production between South Korea and Germany, although web drama is the more common term for web series in South Korea. One could say the main characters are played by one of the tallest buildings on earth, the Lotte World Tower in Seoul, and the in comparison tiny historical Lottehaus in Wetzlar. In this interview Young Man Kang and Genie Kim are explaining the special connection between one of Asias biggest corporations and the world famous writer and poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, but also about the opportunities web dramas are giving young filmmakers in South Korea.
