## Mathilde Bourbin

Writer, Actress, Producer | Collectif Attention Fragile | France

Mathilde is a French actress, writer and producer. After a PhD in exobiology, she took theater classes in Paris. She then had the chance to work with young authors, and developed a sense for contemporary theater. This led her to create her own production company in 2014, Collectif Attention Fragile, and to write and produce her own theater plays and shows. Her biggest achievement is the web series “Frapuccino”, which includes two seasons and was awarded in more than twenty festivals. As an actress who speaks French, English and German, she had the chance to work abroad, and notably shoot in the last Bond movie “No Time To Die”. For her new project, “Müstache”, she is looking for international producers.
