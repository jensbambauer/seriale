## Anna-Marlene Wirtz

Writer, Producer, Actress | Germany

Anna-Marlene Wirtz, of Welsh & German origin, is an actress working predominantly in Film, Theatre and Voiceover. After having trained and lived in London, she is now based in Berlin. Anna worked on the Hesse produced digital series ANOMALIE (Tag & Nacht Media), playing the role of Luisa Ahrens. She received several nominations and was awarded BEST ACTRESS in a Sci-Fi at Asia Web Awards. In 2013 she co-produced her first Sci-Fi Pilot, STALKER. Spring 2017 Elena and Anna met in Frankfurt and quickly realized they were a perfect match for creative collaborations and destined to be friends. Their ambitions grew with 1-minute sketches, and they ended up in the web series EMMY & CHRISTIN. It was clear to both of them that they wanted to create something they would like to watch themselves, which meant it had to be a story about the friendship between women, conflicts, absurdity, adventure and blood, of course.
