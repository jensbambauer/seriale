## Jana Laemmerer  

Director of Photography | Germany

Jana Laemmerer (b. 1984) is a Berlin-based Director of Photography working across narrative features and series for streaming platforms and television networks. After hands-on training at ARRI Labs and working as a 2nd AC and lighting technician, she studied cinematography at Munich Film School. She graduated in 2017 with the short “Shattered”, which screened at Camerimage. Her work is shaped by a love for emotional depth and cinematic sensitivity — she’s drawn to stories that are honest, character-driven, and visually rich. At the core of her visual approach is strong creative collaboration: working closely with directors to bring their vision to life through images that feel bold, intimate, and emotionally grounded. Jana also shoots select commercial and documentary projects worldwide.
