## Kyle Leland

Writer, Creator | United States

Kyle Leland studied comedy and film production between Chicago & LA since he was a teenager. He made around 20 shorts in film school using a razor blade and tape to edit 16mm film from a Bolex camera. While he was still in school, he started a career as a Production Assistant wrangling extras on major film sets which lasted about 10 years. He worked on productions like Wanted, Contagion, Transformers, Chicago Fire, Shameless, Divergent, & many others. During this period, he also shot and edited local commercials and documentaries for companies such as the Chicago Cubs, Blackhawks, Bud Light, Subaru, and more. He now produces, writes, and directs personal projects, some of which have screened at The Chinese Theatre (LA), Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago, and the Cannes Film Festival 2018.
