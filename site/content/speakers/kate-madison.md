Creative Entrepreneur, Director, Producer, Actress | United Kingdom

Kate is mostly known for directing, producing and acting in her Lord of the Rings prequel “Born of Hope” which was released on the internet back in December 2009 and has since gained over 75 million views. Her award-winning fantasy series “Ren: The Girl with the Mark” just finished filming its second season in May 2023 with Kate directing the first of the four episodes.
