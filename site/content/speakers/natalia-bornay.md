## Natalia Bornay

Producer, Writer | Australia 

Natalia is a Spanish-born Australian producer and screenwriter based in Melbourne. She holds a PhD in Film Studies focused on the impact of Spanish female directors. This academic journey inspired her to become a filmmaker dedicated to creating bold, female-driven films that explore identity, migration, and sexuality through underrepresented voices. Co-founding Dos Hermanas Productions with Emily Davis, Natalia aims to promote authentic, diverse, and inclusive representation both in front of and behind the camera. Their debut project, Lady Priest, is a comedy about navigating bonkers family dynamics as a second-generation Australian. It won Best Pilot at Melbourne WebFest and has been an official selection at several national and international film festivals. 

Currently, Natalia is developing the Lady Priest web series, finalising the script for a new dark comedy about sexual harassment, and in post-production for the short film Lara, set in regional Victoria.
