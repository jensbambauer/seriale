## Frédéric Zeimet 

Writer, Director, Producer | Six Letters | Luxembourg

Frédéric Zeimet is a Luxembourgish-born screenwriter and director. Diagnosed with dyslexia from an early age on, he has always had trouble expressing himself. For a long time, he found refuge in mathematics before he discovered the power of pictures and his need to tell stories. After studying History of Art and Archeology, Frédéric has been mentored by Luc Dardenne (the multi-awarded Belgian director) during his screenwriting studies. He recently took his first step as a director. His first short-film “Cowboy” has been selected to over 20 festivals around the world. He wrote, directed and produced the first Luxembourgish Web-series “W.” on a small budget. The six first episodes were awarded with “Best Short Drama” at Stareable Web Fest, the “Gold Award” for Best International Series at DC Webfest or “Best Screenplay” at the Seriale. It finished in second place at the Web Series World Cup 2020. The second season of “W.” with 8 new episodes came out in 2022.
