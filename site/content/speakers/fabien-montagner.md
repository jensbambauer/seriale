After film school in 1995-1998, Fabien began his professional career as a chief editor for French television (documentaries, television programmes, trailers, short films, etc.). He’s still chief editor, which is his main job. He made his first short film, “Le monde de Raoul”, in 2002 and his second, the comedy “Heureux événement”, in 2004. It was shown in 7 countries. In 2006 he directed “Grand Hôtel”, a black comedy short, and in 2011 his first fantasy film “Le Passage”, which was selected for over 50 international festivals. His latest short film “The Friend”, a very short horror film of 4 minutes, was produced to present the script of his first feature film “The Friend”, and was able to participate in twenty festivals around the world. “Bugarach” is his first TV series, and he’s currently working on several other series projects (including the Bugarach sequel) and feature films.
