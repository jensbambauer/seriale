## Timo Landsiedel  

Journalist & Podcaster | Germany

Timo Landsiedel is professionally passionate about the entertainment industry for about 25 years – whether in film production, TV comedy, journalism or podcast. With a background in film and media studies he worked on film sets where he acquired technical knowledge and learned the finesse of storytelling. He deepened these skills during his traineeship as a magazine journalist writing about the film industry. For several years he managed two print magazines in the cinematography and filmmaking field as editor-in-chief. To have a glimpse in fiction he also wrote as a comedy author for a sketch comedy on television. He currently writes for several magazines and he also produces and hosts his own cinematography podcast HINTER DER KAMERA. When he is not holding a microphone in someone’s face, you can find him on one of the coasts of his North German homeland. Whatever the weather.
