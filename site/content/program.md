What new ideas and formats are being developed? What is the status and where is the development going? Digital Series will be examined from a film and media analytical perspective. In addition to analyzing the creation of web series and discussing series from this year's selection, current trends will be reflected under the guiding theme of “Change”.<br/> This year's panel discussions and presentations will be dedicated to the question of what changes web series production is facing, for example the extent to which artificial intelligence and virtual production are finding their way into the world of series. Green production is also becoming an increasingly important topic in series production. In addition, the representation of masculinity and the construction of gender identities in the series will be reflected in the context of the existing diversity in the series.<br/><br/>Location: Kleines Haus Stadttheater Giessen, Ostanlage 43, 35390 Giessen"

And how do you produce this proof? In this panel creators and distributors will talk about what kind of proof is required in the industry and most importantly, what makes a good proof of concept."

#   heading: Our values
#   text: >-
#     Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too – one
#     of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives. We
#     want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s
#     exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.
