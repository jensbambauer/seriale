Which new ideas and formats are being developed? Where are we at, and where are we going? And how can we theorize Digital Series through a film and media analytical perspective? Besides the theoretical reflection of Digital Series, this year's focus will be on the work of the creators. We'll take a special look at sound design and story development."

#   heading: Our values
#   text: >-
#     Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too – one
#     of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives. We
#     want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s
#     exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.
