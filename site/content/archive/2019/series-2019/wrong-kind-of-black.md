## Wrong Kind of Black
Country: Australia | Genre: Drama, Comedy | Director: Catriona McKenzie | Writers: Nick Musgrove, Boori Monty Pryor

At the height of the ‘70s disco inferno, Monty Pryor is Melbourne’s hottest DJ. Dubbed ‘The Black Superman’, Monty and his younger brother Paul spin tunes and rub shoulders with a motley crew of Russian mobsters and Aussie yobbos alike. The ‘fro and the flares seem like worlds away from their childhood on remote Palm Island – but not much has changed. Aboriginal culture is still not welcome in white society, and the price of its preservation can be deadly.
