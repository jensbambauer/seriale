Azmodeus is a low-level demon working in literal corporate hell. His world changes with a phone call summoning him to the top office, where he finds out that Lucifer has retired, and promoted Az to CEO in his place. With little help and no allies Az must navigate a new level of office politics, deal with powerful enemies who would like his job - preferably over his dead body - and fix the corporation while trying to solve the mystery of why he was chosen.
