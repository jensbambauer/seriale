## Taste | German Festival Premiere
Country: United States | Genre: Documentary | Director: Kevin Longa | Writers: Kevin Longa, Steven Matthew Sterrett

From snail farmers to renegade chefs to self-proclaimed "food hookers", with ”Taste” you'll enter a world that explores beyond the plate in front of us. You will meet several of these culinary pioneers: Andreas Gugumuck, a man who ditched his job at IBM in order to resurrect the lost art of snail farming in Vienna; Thunder Zachary, a former criminal who learns the slang of the kitchen; and Zdenek Pohlreich, a celebrity chef who 'whips' his way to culinary success.
