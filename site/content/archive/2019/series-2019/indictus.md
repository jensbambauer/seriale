## Indictus | German Premiere
Country: Italy | Genre: Adventure, Action, Drama | Director: Francesco Dinolfo | Writer: Marianna Lo Pizzo

It all begins with a legend, the legend of the 46 Norman soldiers that, with the help of Saint George, killed 3000 Arabs in a single night in 1063. After that, Sicily became 
an easy conquest for the military forces of France. A fight between two great religions that brings back the conflict to our present days. From this legend, a new hero is born in Cerami: Serlon The Warlord!
