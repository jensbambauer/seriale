## Frank | German Festival Premiere
Country: UK | Genre: Drama | Writer & Director: Luke Aherne

We first met Frank in a pilot episode released in 2012. Here the slow, thoughtful and methodical hitman, haunted by memories of his long lost mother, set “Frank“ apart from other dramas set in the criminal underworld of Glasgow. In these three new episodes, we see Frank reluctantly take on another job from his long-term handler, Jim. However, Frank soon finds himself breaking first rule of the job; don’t get involved. After finding himself drawn into this moral maze, can Frank ever find a way out?
