## How To Know If Youâ€™re Dating a Narcissist | German Premiere
Country: Australia | Genre: Edutainment, Comedy | Writer & Director: Kristy Best

Lifestyle parody with an earnest goal to educate women of the signs, traits and patterns of a narcissistic relationship. Fronted by potty-mouthed, narcissist survivor, Kristy Best and slimy narcissist Derek, the duo conscientiously depicts the lifecycle of a narcissistic relationship, from its blissful start to torturous end. The series bounces between dating reenactments and instructional pieces to camera, as Kristy endeavours to stop you from making the same mistakes she did.
