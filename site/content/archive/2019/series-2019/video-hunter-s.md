## VideoHunterS | German Festival Premiere
Country: Germany | Genre: Documentary | Writer & Director: Daniel Hyan

The video cassette is dead - long live the video cassette! Bart & Daniel want to complete their video collection, but they have to hurry: video stores are threatened with extinction and at flea markets itâ€™s getting harder to find interesting tapes. On their journey across Germany, the two visit legendary video stores, collectors, film markets and even a youth protection agency, following in the footsteps of an important chapter in recent film history.
