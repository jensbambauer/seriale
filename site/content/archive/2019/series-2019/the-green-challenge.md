## The Green Challenge | German Premiere
Country: Germany | Genre: Comedy, Environment | Director: Alexander Resch | Creator & Writer: Annette Krossa

Heike and Martin are fed up with city life: the job is precarious, the rent is far too expensive. Frustrated by high rents, vegetables in plastic, the raging city life, they move into a countryside commune and become self-provider. Who will they encounter here? Organic madness, veganism, containering, alternative healing... The alternative practitioner, the organic bourgeois, the YouTube activist - everyone is on board. A contradictory bunch that sometimes even wins.
