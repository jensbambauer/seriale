## Hungry Bytes | German Festival Premiere
Country: Switzerland | Genre: Documentary | Creators & Directors: Jessica Reust, Sandhya Mirajkar

We love food. We are digital. Two megatrends collide! "Hungry Bytes - Food becomes digital" shows how digitalisation is changing our eating habits - and eventually the entire food industry. In this four-part web series we visit people whose lives are influenced by the digital transformation. We observe, classify and challenge the implications of these changes for society and our environment.
