## Other Peopleâ€™s Children | German Festival Premiere
Country: United States | Genre: Comedy | Creators & Directors: Anna Maria Hozian, Brad Riddell 

Margot Antler dreams of becoming a renowned novelist with a three-book deal and a summer house in Ghent. Reality check: she's a rookie second-grade teacher about to experience the insanity of parent/teacher conferences for the first time! In each episode, Ms. Antler finds herself across the table from adults behaving like children, and slowly comes to realize: it's not her students who have problems, it's their parents.
