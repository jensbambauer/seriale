## Buschka discovers Germany | World Festival Premiere
Country: Germany | Genre: Documentary | Creator & Director: Jörg Buschka 

Reporter Jörg Buschka walks through German cities without any shooting schedule and meets random people and places, gets invited into private homes, to parties, and into exciting buildings or institutes. It's all about observing and listening to what kind of beauty and excitement is hiding behind "ordinariness". It can always be the person next door who holds the key to a wonderful or interesting story.
