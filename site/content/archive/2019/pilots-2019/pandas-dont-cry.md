## Pandas donâ€™t cry
Country: Germany | Genre: Drama | Writer & Director: Gina Wenzel

A Farm. A couple of chickens. A couple of sheep and seven city-kids between parties, drugs, petty crimes and search for meaning, who get the unique chance to a fresh start on a therapy farm. They are wild, sad, loud, desperate, silent, reasonable, in love, baffling and have always something to say.
