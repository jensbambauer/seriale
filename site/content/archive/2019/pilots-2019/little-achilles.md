## Little Achilles | World Premiere
Country: Germany | Genre: Adventure | Director: Sebastian Jansen | Writers: Benhur Prabhu Bosco, Ranjani Prasad, Sebastian Jansen

Ten-year-old Alex gets his bike stolen by the well-known bully Georg. Alex’s father tries to calm his son’s furiosity about this theft by telling him an epic bedtime story: the story of the Siege of Troy and the Greek hero Achilles. Alex imagines his friends and himself to be part of the story and thus experiences the rise and fall of the great Achilles vividly.
