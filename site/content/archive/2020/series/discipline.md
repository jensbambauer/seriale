## Discipline 
Country: South Korea | Genre: Drama, Queer, Comedy | Director: Han Jaeun | Writer: Sin Eunbyeol

An ordinary neighborhood in Korea: a tranquil small town. Tae-Woo and his best friends live there and they do all kinds of things together, good and bad. The five of them decide to go to a party, hosted by a squad from the notorious Samdeok High, in an abandoned basement parking lot. They go there, thinking they would have the time of their lives, but little did they know of the dangers that were to come.
