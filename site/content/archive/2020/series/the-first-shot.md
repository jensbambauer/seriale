Not known as one who stands out in a crowd, Lee Ho Yeon is the very definition of an average man. He is a timid pharmaceutical salesman, socially awkward and painfully shy.

With this odd gift in his possession, Ho Yeon soon finds himself making friends and closing deals. Amazed by this strange turn of events, he couldn't be happier.
