## Grandma Sofía
Country: Argentina | Genre: Documentary | Director: Andrés Serebrenik | Writers: Andrés Serebrenik, Santiago Korovsky

This documentary web series shows the encounters between a grandson and his grandmother in the last years of her life.

Each episode, apart from commemorating each encounter, builds a story, a reason and a motivation to keep learning from each other and to share time together.
