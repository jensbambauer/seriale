After the sudden death of his mother, twenty-year-old Jan's life is turned upside down. Has she been lying to him for a decade? Was she not his mother? Traces of his birth parents lead Jan from tranquil Bremerhaven to Darmstadt. Here the events start to thicken and answers lead to new questions. Plagued by odd visions, Jan finds first clues and perhaps even some friends. Together they come across an experiment that has been hushed up decades ago and attract some dangerous attention. Jan, now pursued from every side, puts himself and his surroundings in danger and faces a threat that pushes the boundaries of reality.
