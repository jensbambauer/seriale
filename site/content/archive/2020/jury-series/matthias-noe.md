## Matthias Noe

Creator | Germany

Born and raised near Hanau, the birthplace of the Brothers Grimm, Matthias instantly fell under the spell of legends and tales of the supernatural. While studying in Mainz, he proofread screenplays for ZDF Enterprises, Germany's largest broadcaster of fictional programs, and sought every opportunity to work on film sets. After graduating he worked as continuity, assistant director, and eventually as visual effects artist for nationwide programs in German TV and advertising, designing visual effects and title sequences whilst never forgetting about his own stories. Eventually he teamed up with producer Dominik Lando and a dedicated crew of film professionals to launch the web series project "Spessart Tales", that has so far produced three episodes with the fourth episode in the making.
