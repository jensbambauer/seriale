The film was made at “Schauspiel Essen” and is based on the novel by Marlen Haushofer, the VR version was created by Thomas Krupa.<br/><br/>Suddenly there is a wall. In the middle of the landscape - invisible, impenetrable, endless. Yesterday, the nameless woman was waving at her cousin and her husband, who were only going into the village for a short while - today she wakes up and is alone in their hunting lodge. Only the dog Luchs is still with her. Outside the wall there is complete standstill, inside the will to survive of those left behind awakens. Together with some animal companions, the narrator gets to know the beauty and horror of untamed nature far away from any civilisation, experiences moments of great sadness and surprising contentment, feels loneliness and freedom in equal measure. Just when she no longer expects it, a man suddenly appears in the seclusion of her existence. Is this the end of the nightmare? Or its beginning?"

Despite the branding, a high level of quality is achieved, and the content aspects of the series are never neglected. These series typically have an audience of millions. Young Man Kang from Seoul introduces this successful concept and its spread in South Korea. He is the director of the renowned Seoul Webfest, one of the world's largest web festivals, of the Asia Web Awards and since this year of LA Webfest. He is a film producer, and his company YMK Films focuses on branded series.

#   heading: Our values
#   text: >-
#     Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too – one
#     of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives. We
#     want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s
#     exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.
