## Thomas Meudt 

Producer | Tag & Nacht Media | Germany 

Thomas was raised between Darmstadt and Frankfurt and had fun very early in his life making music. Over the following years, he wrote his first songs and lyrics, played in several bands and created songs for a solo project. There was only one way to go on, so the next step was to study producing music, sound design and concepting multimedia projects. Getting to know his nowaday colleagues Stephan and Christian, the three founded Tag & Nacht Media – a production company for mainly audiovisual contents. With their first series, “MEM“, Thomas, Christain and Stephan took their first step into the field of storytelling in series format. A few years later, the mystery series “Anomalie“ was the first full-length series production with ten episodes of 20 min each. After a lot of successful national and international festivals, Thomas is part of the seriale jury for the second time
