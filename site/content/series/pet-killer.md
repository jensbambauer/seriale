## Pet Killer
Country: France | Genre: Dark Comedy | Director: Tibo Pinsard | Writers: Tibo Pinsard, Paul Michael Ayre

Brooks is a loving brother to his sister Laura. He's also a hitman for people's furry friends â€“ despite gaining this admittedly macabre reputation through no fault of his own. But when you're only 20 and orphan, what wouldn't you do to keep your sister away from the clutches of an evil step-mother?
