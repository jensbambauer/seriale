## Hammersmith | International Premiere
Country: United States | Genre: Comedy, Action, Mockumentary | Director: Kyle Leland | Writer: Kyle Leland

Ryan Hammersmith is the butt-kicking, international spy, brainchild of filmmaker Bayou Straights. Bayou is documented through behind-the-scenes footage during the production of his first action franchise. While he & Executive Producer, Nile Harbor, constantly bring the production close to catastrophe, the cast & crew must give them harsh reality checks without losing their jobs. Will Bayou listen & keep the Hammersmith Trilogy alive, or will he become just another hack in the industry?
