## Do You Know Vlog 
Country: Germany | Genre: Documentary | Director: Leon Spanier 

Every human being has a story and message to share with the world. Our goal is to give people a voice which is so often neglected in everyday life. With visual storytelling we give them a stage where they can communicate their thoughts freely and we pursue their stories by looking deep into their eyes. We listen, share and reflect.
