## Awkwardly | German Festival Premiere
Country: United States | Genre: Comedy | Written & Created by: Nikki Coble

A broken-hearted New Yorker’s search for something special at the liquor store, unfurls a chain of connection as unexpected as it is universal. Written and directed by women, AWKWARDLY is a pocket-sized original series with a mighty quirky heart, linking twenty endearingly off-beat individuals in a full circle loop of life’s awkward moments. The episodes flow from sweet to silly, to absurd and poignant… as we do. As life does. We’re all connected… AWKWARDLY.
