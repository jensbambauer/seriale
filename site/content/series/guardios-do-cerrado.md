## Guardiões do Cerrado | World Premiere
Country: Brazil | Genre: Documentary | Director: Fábio Erdos

The Cerrado savanna occupies ¼ of the Brazilian territory. More than half of Cerrado’s territory has already suffered deforestation. Traditional and Indigenous people have lived in the Brazilian savanna Cerrado for more than 12 thousand years. These communities presented in the series haven't suffered the impacts of deforestation yet, but this reality can soon change if the rhythm of deforestation and production of commodities continues.
