## Public Writer (Season 2) 
Country: Canada | Genre: Drama | Director: Eric Piccoli | Writers: Michel Duchesne, Eric Piccoli

Mathieu works as a public writer in a community center in Montreal. Soon he discovers that his role is much more about humans than literature: he must first listen and then find the words to console his touching customers. In the midst of austerity, the survival of the center is threatened since its grant has not been renewed. On top of this, a real estate developer wants to buy the building and build brand new condos.
