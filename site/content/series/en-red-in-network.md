Lucas is Lucas-InNet, a famous youtube-nocookier, who receives a message in his whatsapp: 'You have ten days to prove that your existence is worth it'. Lucas discovers through images that were sent to him, that he is dealing with someone who controls him very closely. Through the videos he produces for his channel, Lucas tries to validate his existence. They are the most precious thing he has. The network gave him everything, but it also took everything away in the blink of an eye. Now he does not exist anymore. Views: 0. Subscribers: 0.
