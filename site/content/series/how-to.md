## How To (European Festival Premiere)
Country: Italy | Genre: Experimental, Dramedy | Director: Francesco Di Giorgio | Writer: Valentina Ghetti

"How To" is an artistic response to the immobility in which the world is forced to remain during the COVID-19 pandemic. Six short videos depict human and spiritual adaptation scenarios. Portraits of an apparently distorted, yet never immobile humanity.
