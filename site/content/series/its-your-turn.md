## It's your turn 
Country: Spain | Genre: Horror, Comedy | Directors: Rose of Dolls, Oliver Mend | Writers: Rose of Dolls, Oliver Mend

Ten students travel to a lonesome island to study the Basque language. Some of them start to die… But who is the killer? - 'It’s your turn' is the first basque slasher series, created thanks to the Department of Culture and Linguistic Politics of the Basque Government. The series is an homage to a whole history of horror, intrigue and mystery cinema and television, and a meta-cinematographic approach to reflecting on film history, without taking yourself too seriously. What the viewer can await is lots of blood, lots of deaths, lots of action, while the protagonists want to answer only one question: Who is the killer?
