## Dele Viaje | German Festival Premiere
Country: Costa Rica | Genre: Drama, LGBTQ | Writer & Director: Jose Pablo García Montero

Dele Viaje is a popular Costa Rican phrase, that encourages people to overcome fear. Pupis, Beto, and Carlos are three young adults struggling to feel normal in our world. Their stories run parallel: Pupis, an inventive and neurotic girl from the past, is now adjusting to life in modern day San José; Beto lost his girlfriend and, along the way, a piece of who he was; and Carlos, a defeated soccer player, is slowly realizing that his frustration might be a product of his own denial as a gay man.
