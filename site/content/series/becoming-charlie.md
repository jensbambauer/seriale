“Becoming Charlie” tells the story of Charlie's search for identity. Charlie feels neither like a woman nor like a man. But what is Charlie? The search for and discovery of the own non-binarity catapults not only Charlie but also Charlie's environment out of the comfort zone and shakes up seemingly irrefutable truths. Only in rap does Charlie find a constant and an outlet for own feelings.
