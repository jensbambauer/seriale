## La Festa Triste 
Country: Italy | Genre: Mystery, Game-Series | Director: Mattia Marcucci | Writers: Chiara Bonome, Mattia Marcucci

This web series is an experimental format that was created with the aim to combine new forms of communication (the Web) with classic artistic forms (Cinema and Theater), to bring the general public closer to a new type of interactivity. It's a surreal thriller with grotesque characters that alternates highly comic moments with others of profound inner restlessness. Reality alternates with fantasy - the truth is never obvious.
