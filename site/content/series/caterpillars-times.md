## Caterpillars’ Times (Season 2) | European Premiere
Country: Canada | Genre: Drama, Comedy | Writer & Director: Catherine White

It's a warm winter towards north on a Christmas spirit. Alix and Bibi are going to spend the holidays in their native region. Alix has not set foot in her family home since last summer after her parents kicked her out. Luckily, Bibi is there by her side, more crazy than ever. Otherwise, the holidays may be less festive. Especially since Alix lost her wallet somewhere along the way. But things change when the caterpillars are sleeping. It's a weird holiday season, not too relaxing.
