## Shadow Man
Country: Germany | Genre: Horror | Director: Emrah Erdogru | Writer: Emrah Erdogru

Shadow people are human-like figures who live in the darkness. They lurk in dark corners and observe us. Sometimes, if we are quick enough, we can see them. When this takes place, something bad is going to happen.
