## Matrimoine (German Festival Premiere)

Country: Canada | Genre: Documentary | Director: Ariel Saint-Louis Lamoureux

The series presents the conversations of seven grandmother-granddaughter duos grouped into eight thematic episodes. The discussions of each of the duos intertwine to paint a diverse portrait of women's experiences and to take a tender look at the delicate issue of feminism.
