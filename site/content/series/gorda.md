Joy is a 27-year-old, obese jew, with a wry sense of humor. Unsatisfied with her professional and emotional life and, after suffering bullying in silence since her days at primary school, she lets her wild side out. She proudly accepts her condition, making us think about social hypocrisy and its prejudices.
