Every year 20,000 people suffer from chlamydia and Sasha "Sas" van Zanten has just become one of the unfortunate winners of this STI bingo. Sas has to tell her bed partners about her infection, but her focus is really on the fact that someone didn't tell her! As she tries to solve this mystery, she also tries to tell her bed partners that they may have an STI. But how do you actually talk about this? How do you open that conversation?
