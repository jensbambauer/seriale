## Top Dogs: Homicides
Country: Canada | Genre: Comedy | Director: Pierre-Luc Miville | Writer: Alexandre Bisaillon, Guillaume Lacelle, Odr√©e Rousseau 

Detectives Patenaude and Detroit are two wacky, immature, and, however, brilliant detectives. For example, when the evidence suggests a suicide, they will prove that it is a murder involving nine pairs of underpants. But they can't even imagine what's cooking right under their nose.
