Over 450 minutes long, 3 years of production, many festivals, many small TV stations. 10 years ago there was the first screening as a test screening in Hamburg of perhaps the longest independently produced German web series. FILMSTADT is now in its teens and we celebrate with a Making of FILMSTADT. Thanks to the whole team!
