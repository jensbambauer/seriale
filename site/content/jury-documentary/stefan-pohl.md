## Stefan Pohl 

Freelance Filmmaker, DoP, Editor | Stefan Pohl Design & Film | Germany

Stefan Pohl is a graduate designer and filmmaker from Darmstadt in southern Hessen. Since 2010, he’s been working mainly as a freelance cameraman and editor in TV, documentary and corporate film. In addition, he serves on the supervisory board of the Frankfurt film cooperative United Creative Studio, where various series and film projects are collaboratively developed and realized. With his documentary “Hello my name is - German Graffiti”, he toured German cinemas in 2015 with over 120 screenings and it is also available as VoD in 81 countries and five languages. Another highlight of the last few years was the camera work and the editing of the Arte documentary on the centenary of the silent film classic Nosferatu. The documentary format has a special meaning for him. Ideally, a good documentary gives the viewer the feeling of having come so close to the protagonists as if you had met them in person and changes our view of social structures and our environment.
