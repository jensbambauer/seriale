## Stefan Pohl

Filmmaker, DoP, Editor | Stefan Pohl Film | Germany

Stefan Pohl is a graduate designer, cameraman, editor, and filmmaker from Darmstadt in southern Hesse. He has been involved in art and design since his youth and is closely connected to the graffiti and street art scene. In 2007, while studying communication design, he discovered film as his preferred medium. Since 2010, he's been working as a freelance cameraman and editor. With his documentary “Hello my name is - German Graffiti”, he toured German cinemas in 2015 with over 120 screenings. The film is available as VoD in 81 countries around the world. A highlight of the last few years was the camera work and the editing of the Arte documentary on the centenary of the silent film classic Nosferatu. The documentary format has a special meaning for him. Ideally, a good documentary gives the viewer the feeling of having come so close to the protagonists as if you had met them in person and changes our view of social structures and our environment.
