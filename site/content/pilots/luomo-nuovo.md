## L'Uomo Nuovo | German Premiere
Country: Italy | Genre: Drama, Thriller, Dystopic | Director: Andrea Murchio | Writer: Andrea Murchio

Only 24 hours to decide the fate of Italy. Power games, scandals and plot twists take turns, conditioning the lives of a group of characters in a future dystopian scenario. 2026 in Italy: the social and political crisis that hit the country is far from being solved. The nation is being hit by economical default as a result of outrageous ultra-conservative and anti-European policies pursued by the Castelli Government, which has been leading the country for the past twenty years. This situation has led to a drastic solution: Italy left the European Union with dramatic consequences for economy and society.
