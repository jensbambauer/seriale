It's a normal night for Bullet and Lilly. They want to commit one last gas station robbery before they settle to the Caribbean, to start a new life there. But this night will not go as the two have planned. When they leave the gas station, the world has become a different one.
Acoustically, Bullet and Lilly are accompanied by radio host Linda, who comments on the events of this catastrophic night.
