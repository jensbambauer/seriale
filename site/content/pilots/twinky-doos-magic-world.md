Selva, Mara and Pluto are three criminals who grew up together on the ill-famed streets of a suburban city. They attempted a robbery at “Twinky Doo’s Magic World”, a theme park for families, but everything went downhill because of Leo, the latest addition to the gang. The four of them ended up hiding inside a warehouse, dragging a hostage with them, Roberto - an employee of the park - and now they are besieged by the police. However, the real threat is not outside.
