                      details: "In serial storytelling, world-building is not just about crafting immersive fictional spaces or character constellations – it also reflects and negotiates social values, worldviews, and political imaginaries. This panel brings together media scholars and series creators to explore how narrative worlds are constructed, and how they, in turn, shape our understanding of the world we live in. What values and ideologies are embedded in visual storytelling? How do serial formats influence collective imagination, identity, and discourse? And to what extent do fictional worlds anticipate or reflect real social change? Part of the Educational Section, this conversation opens a space for critical reflection on the cultural function of serial narratives – between theory, creation and reception."

#   heading: Our values
#   text: >-
#     Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too – one
#     of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives. We
#     want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s
#     exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.
