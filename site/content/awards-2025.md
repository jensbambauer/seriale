        - text: "This year’s nominees in the Best Documentary category took us around the globe — to places such as Spain, Colombia, Russia, Switzerland, Portugal, France, and Canada — and gave us deep insights into the worlds they explored. But one stood out by turning a complex, hidden realm into something both gripping and unforgettable. With outstanding craftsmanship in every frame — from bold directing to stunning cinematography, sharp editing, and beautifully integrated motion graphics — this series transformed what could have been a dry story into a thrilling, cinematic experience. It kept us on the edge of our seats. It was fearless, relevant, and told with a profound sense of responsibility. A brave story, with brave protagonists, that surpassed our expectations by shedding light on the dark depths of greed and the collapse of a giant."

      paragraphs:
        - text: "With “Soul Shift”, the creators deliver a refreshingly bold animated series that blends absurdist humor, social commentary, and vibrant visual storytelling. Reminiscent of “Rick & Morty”, the show’s distinct cartoon style and unexpected gags create an experience that is both thought-provoking and wildly entertaining. The show balances clever satire with a genuinely original concept – souls jumping into new bodies, prompting existential and societal questions along the way. An animated project from Germany that feels globally relevant and tonally confident. Full of creative potential – we’re excited to see where this journey leads."
