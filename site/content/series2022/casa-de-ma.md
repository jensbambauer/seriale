## Casa De Ma

Country: Spain | Genre: Dark Comedy, Drama | Director: Andrea Meneses | Writers: Gabriela Cortés, Andrea Meneses

The eight superheroines fighting to save Ma have neither superpowers nor tight suits, but well-placed ovaries. "How are we going to take on a kidnapper alone?" The answer is: no fucking idea. And that’s what “Casa de Ma” is about: a group of women who will face themselves and a well-known villain.
