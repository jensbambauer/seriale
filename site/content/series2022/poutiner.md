## Poutiner (World Festival Premiere)

Country: Australia | Genre: Documentary, Comedy, Adventure | Director: Olivier Bonenfant | Writer: Olivier Bonenfant

It's a borderless homage to poutines created in less than favorable conditions. Travel around the world with this weird cultural exchange. "Poutiner", it's 21 poutines clumsily assembled with local ingredients in 14 different countries by a guy who simply got lost on the way to the restaurant.
