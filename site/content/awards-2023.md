          - text: "Tito Bilbao tells the dramatic journey of a washed-up soccer commentator in a charmingly exaggerated way. Soccer is an arena that can be easily overloaded with clichés and lame jokes. But the creators chose for a quirky satire that embraces its flawed characters. Auditive and visual stylistic means are well balanced, as none of them is pushed into the foreground. They all follow the beautiful rhythm of the narrative that doesn't overwhelm the viewer but charmingly takes them by the hand. Thus the focus lies on the overall work of art.But we would like to particularly mention the script that charmed us: very funny writing that - without obsessing on big gag density - draws a surprising plot while staying very close to its cranky characters. Viewing habits are charmingly broken by hints that are not necessarily redeemed, but casually come by - as in real life.An animated series like this is usually a big production that requires many hands that lead to unwanted compromises. But through an admirable reduction of stylistic devices to the core of the narrative, Jonathan and Lucas have succeeded to share a very personal vision with us. Many thanks."

          - text: "Filmmaking is a collaborative art form, but it still requires a strong leader to guide the team to create a believable story. The director creates the tone, decides the vision and shapes the performances to make the audience laugh or cry. We feel this director did just that, creating a production that left us both uncomfortable at times, yet also inspired for change."

        paragraphs:
          - text: "A screenplay is constructed from a series of letters and punctuation, without which bad writing like this would not exist look up and make eye contact with audience... But without good writing, even the best-looking series would fall flat on its face. Despite what Hollywood studios seem to think, writers are an incredibly important part of the filmmaking process. This year’s winning screenplay effectively uses dialogue and at – times absurd situations to tell a story with not just humor but a surprising amount of heart as well."
