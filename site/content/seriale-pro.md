# blurb:
#   heading: Why Kaldi?
#   text: >-
#     Kaldi is the coffee store for everyone who believes that great coffee
#     shouldn't just taste good, it should do good too. We source all of our beans
#     directly from small scale sustainable farmers and make sure part of the
#     profits are reinvested in their communities.
# intro:
#   heading: What we offer
#   text: >-
#     Kaldi is the ultimate spot for coffee lovers who want to learn about their
#     java’s origin and support the farmers that grew it. We take coffee
#     production, roasting and brewing seriously and we’re glad to pass that
#     knowledge to anyone.

#     text: >-
#       We sell green and roasted coffee beans that are sourced directly from
#       independent farmers and farm cooperatives. We’re proud to offer a variety
#       of coffee beans grown with great care for the environment and local
#       communities. Check our post or contact us directly for current
#       availability.

#       We offer a small, but carefully curated selection of brewing gear and
#       tools for every taste and experience level. No matter if you roast your
#       own beans or just bought your first french press, you’ll find a gadget to
#       fall in love with in our shop.

#   heading: Our values
#   text: >-
#     Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too – one
#     of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives. We
#     want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s
#     exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.
